          q: "Is it free to convert HEIF to AVIF?",
          a: "Yes! Our HEIF to AVIF converter is completely free with unlimited conversions. No registration, subscriptions, or hidden fees. Convert as many images as you need to the cutting-edge AVIF format.",
        },
        {
          q: "How much smaller are AVIF files compared to JPEG and WebP?",
          a: "AVIF files are typically 50% smaller than JPEG and 20% smaller than WebP at equivalent visual quality. For a 1MB JPEG, you'll get a 500KB AVIF with identical or better quality. This state-of-the-art compression reduces bandwidth costs and improves page load times significantly.",
        },
        {
          q: "What is AVIF and why is it better than WebP?",
          a: "AVIF (AV1 Image File Format) is the newest image format based on the AV1 video codec. It offers 20% better compression than WebP, supports HDR (High Dynamic Range) and 12-bit color depth (vs WebP's 8-bit), is completely royalty-free with no patent fees, and is actively used by Netflix and YouTube. AVIF is the next evolution beyond WebP.",
        },
        {
          q: "Is AVIF supported by browsers?",
          a: "AVIF is supported by 80%+ of browsers: Chrome 85+ (2020), Firefox 93+ (2021), Edge 121+ (2024), Safari 16+ (macOS Ventura 2022), and Opera 71+. For older browsers, use the HTML <picture> element with WebP/JPEG fallback for universal compatibility. Browser support is growing rapidly.",
        },
        {
          q: "Does AVIF support HDR (High Dynamic Range)?",
          a: "Yes! AVIF fully supports HDR with 10-bit and 12-bit color depth, unlike JPEG/PNG/WebP which are limited to 8-bit. This means AVIF can display 4,096 shades per color channel (vs 256 for 8-bit), preserving subtle gradients and highlights in high-end photography, HDR displays, and professional imaging workflows.",
        },
        {
          q: "Why is AVIF royalty-free and what does that mean?",
          a: "AVIF uses the AV1 codec developed by the Alliance for Open Media (Google, Apple, Mozilla, Netflix, Amazon). Unlike older codecs (H.264, H.265/HEVC) with patent licensing fees, AV1 is completely royalty-free and open-source. This means no licensing costs for developers, content creators, or users - making AVIF freely available for everyone.",
        },
        {
          q: "Can I use AVIF for professional photography?",
          a: "Absolutely! AVIF's 12-bit color depth, HDR support, and lossless mode make it excellent for professional photography. It preserves subtle tonal gradations better than 8-bit formats, supports wide color gamuts (WCG), and offers film grain synthesis for authentic analog aesthetics. Many professional photographers are adopting AVIF for archival and web delivery.",
        },
        {
          q: "Do Netflix and YouTube really use AVIF?",
          a: "Yes! Netflix uses AVIF for image delivery on their platform to reduce bandwidth while maintaining quality. YouTube uses AVIF for video thumbnails. Facebook/Meta also implements AVIF. Major tech companies are adopting AVIF because it dramatically reduces storage and bandwidth costs while improving user experience.",
        },
        {
          q: "How long does HEIF to AVIF conversion take?",
          a: "Conversion takes 3-5 seconds per file due to AVIF's advanced compression algorithm (more complex than WebP/JPEG). The result is a highly optimized AVIF file with maximum compression and quality. This slight processing time delivers 50% file size savings.",

They're ideal for email attachments (universally supported), printing (maintains quality), presentations (professional appearance), legal documents (tamper-evident), and long-term archival (ISO 19005 standard ensures readability for decades).

          "HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) is a modern image container format that uses HEVC (H.265) compression. While similar to HEIC, HEIF is the standard format name, while HEIC specifically refers to Apple's implementation. HEIF offers superior compression compared to traditional formats while maintaining high image quality.",
